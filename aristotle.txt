Aristotle was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath.Aristotle made important contributions to logic, criticism, rhetoric, physics, biology, psychology, mathematics, metaphysics, ethics, and politics.Aristotle is known for inventing the scientific method of analysis, which can be applied to multiple fields of study.Education is the touchstone of Aristotelian ethics as the virtues, wisdom and happiness are acquired through education and the art of living is something to be learned.According to Aristotle, happiness consists in achieving, through the course of a whole lifetime, all the goods — health, wealth, knowledge, friends, etc. — that lead to the perfection of human nature and to the enrichment of human life.As the father of western logic, Aristotle was the first to develop a formal system for reasoning as he observed that the deductive validity of any argument can be determined by its structure rather than its content.The four causes in Aristotelian thought are the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final.Material Cause means that out of which it is made.Efficient Cause means the source of the objects principle of change or stability.Formal Cause means the essence of the object. Final Cause means the end/goal of the object, or what the object is good for.
